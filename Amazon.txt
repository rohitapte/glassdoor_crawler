My biggest frustration is; If the incentive can no longer be up held then just simply take down the offer. Instead the bonus remains as an incentive in the job que and they just extend a job offer with a different Job ID that does not include the bonus. Be very careful with companies like these. They take advantage of candidate\u2019s failure to pay attention to details. All while not having to pay the bonus promised and still having the advantage of gaining a new worker. Small deceitful acts like this play a huge part in the bigger narrative. The way you do anything is the way you do everything and this proves that companies like these are willing to take short cuts and deceive the public to stay in business. This is a sign of a lack of integrity. We have to have zero tolerance for companies that don't have integrity.

Cool thing about this application is you can add adons that will showcase more data for viewers. One I've added has been job tenure & roles so I can see when looking at peers and other Amazonians profiles. A very common trend that is too apparent to overlook in the amount of time employees of color spend in their roles compared to white counterparts. I literally have AAs who came into the company as Tier 1s that have progressed faster than myself and other black counterparts whom come in with a degrees and as entry level management. Statically speaking on average black employees spend 1.5 -2 years in their roles prior to progression when the average progression within the company is 1 - 1.5 years. \nSo being a white male or female you can literally have no formal secondary education and work within amazon and progress faster than a black employee with a degree that was hired into management. I have personally worked in the company for 3 years with nothing but high marks from all my direct managers with very minimum to no negative feedback and have been given many hoops to jump through. Example I was told at one site I had to learn inbound and outbound before coming a level 5 manager to only find out I had level 7 seniors that had progressed and only been in 1 side of the business their entire career. Also noticed their is certainly a \"boys club\" if you are liked by senior team I've seen people pulled to positions that were never posted and promoted when being in the role for only a few months.

I prefer a reliable set-in-stone schedule, myself, but they also had an option to choose what shifts you wanted from a pool. \n\n- Great way to stay in shape and lose some weight. This is more or less a positive outlook on all the manual labor you'll be doing\n\n- Decent health coverage. There are some pretty decent plans for coverage all around. \n\n- Good experience booster. Because of the ease of access in getting the job and the simplicity of the roles, this is a pretty decent resume booster!\n\n- Time-off flexibility. Amazon will probably be the only job I have where I can just leave whenever I want (so long as I have enough paid time off or time off otherwise to cover it)\n\n- Discount. You get a 10% discount off Amazon-distributed AND produced items so that's kinda cool (*up to $100 in savings).", "cons": "- Isolation. Job gets a little lonely sometimes--especially when we're busy. \n\n-- Soreness. You are on your feet all day, constantly bending your knees. It's easy at first, but doing it long enough really aches your muscles. Make sure you go to bed at a decent hour and drink plenty of water before, during, and after your shift. This job will drain you.\n\n--Alarms. So there's all this warehouse noise going on that makes it a little hard to hear sometimes, but that's to be expected. But when the main conveyor parts go off, wooh boy. You'd think you're working in a nuclear facility! They seem to go off everywhere sometimes\n\n-- Boredom. Kinda goes hand-in-hand with Isolation. This job is VERY UN-stimulating. I'm a picker. I scan items, toss them in bin, press the button to verify the transition, and then rinse and repeat. Try to preoccupy your mind with something .\n\n-- MET. Depending on your shift, you could be called in for mandatory extra time at any moment and that can get annoying. \n\n--Techincal issues. There are annoying technical glitches that happen with my station, sometimes the pods with the items arrive slow, and sometimes amnesty stops my area to fix something and all these issues stall my rate. While the latter two are out of managements control, some of the stations on my floor feel like they've been neglected.
